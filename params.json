  "body": "OPEN MYSQL CRUD UI\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nLists ALL tables in your MySQL db (for now just bellow one another). The tables are then searchable and editable (CRUD - create,read,update,delete) and you can order them. To be used in a safe administration area. It doesn't allow user (web admin in our case) to add columns etc.  \r\nIt is desired to be a easier-to-use alternative to phpmyadmin, which is too complicated to serve a web-admin.  \r\nEditing is saved immediately with ajax. Validation of fields is not supported in this release. \r\n\r\nBuilt upon Vincy's scripts (I extended them from one concrete table to any table), especially  \r\nhttp://phppot.com/php/php-mysql-inline-editing-using-jquery-ajax/  \r\nand  \r\nhttp://phppot.com/php/php-crud-with-search-and-pagination-using-jquery-ajax/  \r\nBig thanks!  \r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n------------\r\nset the MySQL vars on top of scripts/dbcontroller.php  \r\nset the desired number of rows per page on top of scripts/pagination.class.php (default: $this->perpage = 2;)  \r\nrun index.php\r\n\r\nLICENCE\r\n-------\r\nFree even for commercial projects under GPL.\r\n\r\nSUPPORT & COLLABORATION\r\n-------\r\nPaid work accepted, contact me at jakub (a) webisti cz    \r\nMy team's website: http://www.webisti.cz\r\n",
